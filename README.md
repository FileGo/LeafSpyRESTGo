# LeafSpyRESTGo

This project creates a REST server for LeafSpyPro ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Turbo3.Leaf_Spy_Pro)/[iOS](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/leafspy-pro/id967376861)).

It listens out for REST requests sent by the mobile app and stores data in a MySQL/MariaDB database, although it could be easily modified to use any other SQL database. It presents latest and historic data in a SPA webpage.
